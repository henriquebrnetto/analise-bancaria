# Bank Statement Analysis
Automation for Bank Statements Analysis and Create Excel Representations.

- The file "analysis.py" is the main script for this program.
  - To make it easy to use (even if you do not know programming nor Python), you can simply create a python shortcut in your Desktop, and double click it, then it will create the Excel files with the output data into your destination folder, and delete the files used.
  - In the beggining of the script, it moves the .csv files from your Download folder to your destination folder, with the objective to make it even easier to use. With this, just downloading the .csv file into your computer is enough for the program to work (you just have to put the right path on the code).
  - You should also be careful because the script has some particular cases for the data I used, if you want to make it better for your dataset, you should make some changes to the code.
- The file "project_func.py" is a file with some useful functions to deal with data analysis (and machine learning).

Tips for improvement are always welcome :)
