# Bank Statement Analysis
Automation for Bank Statements Analysis and Create Excel Representations.

- The file "analysis.py" is the main script for this program.
  - To make it easy to use (even if you do not know programming nor Python), you can simply create a python shortcut in your Desktop, and double click it, then it will create the Excel file with the organized data into your destination folder.
- The file "project_func.py" is a file with some useful functions to deal with data analysis (and machine learning).

Tips for improvement are always welcome :)
Thank you,

Henrique Bucci.
